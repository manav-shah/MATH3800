    "# Root Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover the topics of root finding. Root finding can be described as a way of finding the numerical solution to the roots of a function. Mathematically, we seek the the values of x for a function such that $f(x) = 0$. We will deal with three root finding algorithms, and their implementations in Python. We will use the scientific libraries [Scipy](https://scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for help along the way.\n",

    "The three algorithms we will look at are:\n",
    "* Bisection method\n",
    "* Fixed-point iteration\n",
    "* Newton's method\n",

    "The Bisection method of root finding works a continuous function $f(x)$ which is known to contain a root over an interval $[a,b]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a is a negative number, and b is a positive number, we know that there must exist an x value $a<x<b$ for which $f(x)=0$ from the Intermediate Value Theorem. \n",
    "The Bisection method estimates the root to be at the midpoint of the interval, at the value \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\">$c = \\frac{a+b}{2}$</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very unlikely that c will be the exact root of the function (if it is, then we are done!). But if it is not, we now know that the interval must be contained within either one of the new intervals $[a,c]$ and $[c,b]$, which are both half the size of the previous interval.  \n",
    "If $f(c)$ is the same sign as $f(a)$,the function has not yet crossed the $x$-axis and thus the root is in the interval $[c,b]$.\n",
    "On the other hand, if $f(c)$ has the opposite sign, the function has crossed the $x$-axis and the root is in $[a,c]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be repeated on the new interval, and again on the resulting interval and so on. We can continue this until the interval is small enough to our liking, and we can estimate it's midpoint as the root. This approach can also be performed for a fixed number of iterations if preferred."
